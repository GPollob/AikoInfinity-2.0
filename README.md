AikoInfinity 2.0

AikoInfinity 2.0 is an advanced AI/ML framework designed for seamless integration of Federated Learning, Edge AI optimization, and dynamic feature generation. This project focuses on privacy-preserving AI, real-time decision-making, and optimized workflows for decentralized systems.


---

Features

Federated Learning: Privacy-first training with data retained on devices.

Edge AI Optimization: Real-time, low-latency decision-making on edge devices.

Dynamic API: Supports integration with AikoInfinity's unique Aikore and image generation APIs.

Differential Privacy: Enhanced security for sensitive data.

Event-Driven Architecture: Efficient, scalable handling of events.

Usage

Federated Learning Example

from src.federated_learning import FederatedModel

# Initialize Federated Model
model = FederatedModel(config_path="config/development.yaml")
model.train()

Edge AI Example

from src.edge_ai import EdgeDevice

# Deploy AI Model on Edge Device
edge_device = EdgeDevice()
result = edge_device.process(input_data)
print(result)


---
